# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.20.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- App no longer gets stuck on "Rate limited" screen after `claude login` (fixes #5)
- Rate limit error now shows "Retry" button instead of incorrectly showing "Settings"
- Credential changes (e.g. after `claude login`) now trigger auto-refresh even when an error is displayed
- Auto-refresh retries after 60s instead of giving up permanently when rate limited with no cached data

## [2.20.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Refresh no longer gets stuck or spins forever — fetch requests are now cancellable with stale response detection
- All retry paths use `[weak self]` to prevent retain cycles and parallel fetch races
- Centralized `finishLoading()` guarantees `isLoading` is always reset (no more missed code paths)
- Safety timeout reduced to 20s and now cancels the in-flight request
- Wake observer cancels stale fetches before refreshing

## [2.20.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- Peak / Off-peak indicator in usage view — shows whether you're in peak hours (Mon–Fri 7am–5pm PT) with countdown to next transition

### Fixed
- Menu bar timer now shows session reset instead of weekly reset when usage is at 0%
- Reset timer displays days/hours for long countdowns (e.g. `3d05h` instead of `77h05m`)

## [2.19.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- Auto-refresh was off by default for new users (UserDefaults returned 0 = "Off" on first launch instead of 2 min)

## [2.19.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- App no longer stops refreshing after Mac sleep/wake — timers are recreated on wake
- Disabled App Nap so refresh timers are never paused by macOS
- Auto-refresh when opening the popover if data is older than 2 minutes
- `isLoading` stuck state: safety timeout after 30s, reset on wake, and proper handling when access token is nil
- 401/403 token refresh no longer enters infinite retry loop

## [2.19.1] - 2026-03-21

### Fixed
- Manual refresh now always bypasses rate limit cooldown (no more stuck "Rate limited" requiring app restart)
- Rate limit cooldown capped to 60s max
- No error message shown when rate limited with cached data — displays existing quotas silently

## [2.19.0] - 2026-03-19

### Performance
- JSONL parsing: eliminate Data→String→Data roundtrip in 5 functions (saves memory on 100MB+ files)
- SQLite: combine 9 queries into 4 per refresh (stats as single subquery, projects derived from summaries)
- Widget: skip update when quotas unchanged (avoid JSON encode + WidgetCenter reload)
- Keychain: read credentials off main thread to prevent UI freezes on startup

### Added
- "brew upgrade claude-god" copy button in update banner

## [2.18.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- Delay first API call by 3s on startup to avoid racing with Claude Code
- `reloadCredentials` no longer reads Keychain — only reads file to avoid interfering with Claude Code's keychain access
- Reduces risk of invalidating Claude Code's OAuth session on app launch

## [2.18.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- GitHub plugin detail view — 26 MCP tools grouped by category (PRs, Issues, Search, Files, Repos), auth status indicator
- Generic plugin detail views for swift-lsp, code-review, code-simplifier, context7, playwright — features list with icons and descriptions
- Plugin update button — "Update to vX.Y.Z" on installed plugins with available updates (runs `claude plugin update`)
- 9 plugins now have custom detail views in the Extensions tab

### Fixed
- Menu bar icon uses system color (black/white) in normal state for better contrast — green/orange/red only for warnings
- Font sizes increased +1pt on small text (7→8, 8→9, 9→10, 10→11) for readability
- App window slightly wider (380→400px)

## [2.17.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Stop refreshing OAuth tokens — reload credentials from disk instead. The single-use refresh token was invalidating Claude Code's copy, forcing repeated `claude login`.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Superpowers plugin detail view — browse all 14 skills with descriptions, categories, and line counts; view implementation plans with progress bars and design specs
- Frontend Design plugin detail view — design principles reference, aesthetic tones palette, anti-patterns checklist, and link to Anthropic's Frontend Aesthetics Cookbook
- Both plugins now appear as featured cards in the Installed tab with "Open" navigation

## [2.16.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Landing page screenshots now display correctly (copied to `docs/images/`)
- Added Extensions tab screenshots to landing page gallery

## [2.16.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Extensions tab — replaces Memory tab with a full plugin marketplace

- Installed sub-tab — manage installed plugins with enable/disable toggle, uninstall, and update indicators
- Featured plugin cards — plugins with custom UI (claude-mem) shown prominently with icon, description, and clickable card to open detail view
- Plugin installation directly from the app via `claude` CLI (`Process()`)
- Category chips for filtering (Development, Productivity, Database, Design, etc.)
- Install count display (e.g. "324.0K") from marketplace data

### Changed
- Memory tab renamed to Extensions; Memory content now accessible via claude-mem's "Open" detail view in Installed
- Plugin data loaded from local `~/.claude/plugins/` files (no network required)

## [2.15.0] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Memory tab now reads the correct `observations` table from claude-mem (was querying non-existent `memories` table)
- Fixed column mappings to match actual claude-mem schema (`memory_session_id`, `narrative`, `files_read`, `files_modified`)

### Added
- Memory activity timeline — bar chart of observations over the last 30 days with summary stats
- Project summaries view — aggregated facts, concepts, and files per project
- Export memories as Markdown — copy all or per-project to clipboard
- Copy/delete individual observations via context menu on each memory row
- Clickable file paths — open referenced files or project folders in Finder
- Type badge on each observation row
- Narrative display in memory rows

## [2.14.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Memory search and project filter
- Stats cards showing total memories, sessions, projects, and weekly count
- Install guide encart when claude-mem is not installed

## [2.13.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- OAuth token refresh no longer persists tokens to `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — prevents daily 401 errors by keeping refreshed tokens in-memory only (Claude Code manages credentials)

## [2.13.0] - 2026-03-16

### Performance
- Single JSON decode per JSONL line via `JSONLContent` Decodable enum (eliminates JSONSerialization + JSONDecoder double-parse)
- Direct `Data` line splitting in `enumerateJSONLines` — avoids Data→String→Data roundtrip
- Single-pass file traversal with `analyzeWithSessions()` combining stats + recent sessions
- `resourceValues(forKeys:)` replaces `attributesOfItem(atPath:)` for file metadata (fewer syscalls)
- `.utility` QoS for background stat computation instead of `.userInitiated`
- Binary search + reverse scan for ROI assisted commit matching
- Dedicated `sessionCost(for:)` avoids re-scanning all files for active session cost

### Changed
- Updated README with 4 real screenshots (Usage, Analytics, Timeline, ROI)

- Reset timer stuck on "now" — auto-refreshes 3s after quota reset
- Multi-account switch flash — keep old data until new quotas arrive
- Menu bar timer overflow — compact format (2h31m instead of 2h 31m 45s)
- Session topic shows "test" — now picks first substantial message (>20 chars)
- Budget field shows $0 — now displays "Not set" placeholder
- CSV export silent failure — button shows "Saved!" or "Failed" feedback
- Duplicate custom alert rules — prevents adding same quota/threshold combo
- Models section layout — aggregate by short name, wider cost column, compact formatting

### Improved

### Changed
- Menu bar icon color now reflects the **worst** quota (highest utilization) instead of always the session quota

- Sparkline chart follows the daily period selector (7d/14d/30d) instead of being hardcoded to 7 days
- Quota cards show relative reset time ("Resets in 2h 31m") instead of absolute time
- High utilization precision: shows one decimal above 95% (e.g. "97.3%"), rounds to 100% above 99.5%
- Countdown hides seconds when timer is not displayed in menu bar (cleaner popover display)
- Notification threshold UX: shows "Alert at 80% used (20% left)" instead of "Remaining < 20%"
